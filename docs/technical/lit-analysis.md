```typescript
// Full TypeScript support with strict mode
@customElement('ds-button-primary')
export class ButtonPrimary extends LitElement {
	@property({ type: String })
	variant: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'tertiary' = 'primary';

	@property({ type: Boolean })
	disabled = false;
}
```

### 3. Browser Support Matrix

**✅ EXCELLENT COMPATIBILITY**

| Browser | Version | Support              | Notes                         |
| ------- | ------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Chrome  | 67+     | ✅ Full              | Native Web Components support |
| Firefox | 63+     | ✅ Full              | Native Web Components support |
| Safari  | 10.1+   | ✅ Full              | Native Web Components support |
| Edge    | 79+     | ✅ Full              | Chromium-based Edge           |
| IE11    | 11      | ⚠️ Polyfill Required | Needs webcomponents polyfill  |

**Polyfill Requirements for IE11:**

- `@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs` polyfill
- `@webcomponents/custom-elements` polyfill
- `@webcomponents/shadycss` for Shadow DOM

### 4. Performance Characteristics

### 7. Potential Challenges and Mitigations

#### ⚠️ IE11 Polyfill Complexity

**Challenge:** IE11 requires multiple polyfills
**Mitigation:**

- Use `@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs` bundle
- Implement feature detection for polyfill loading
- Test thoroughly in IE11 environment

#### ⚠️ Bundle Size with Polyfills

**Challenge:** Polyfills add ~15KB to bundle size
**Mitigation:**

- Load polyfills conditionally for IE11 only
- Use dynamic imports for polyfill loading
- Consider separate IE11 bundle

#### ⚠️ CSS Custom Properties in IE11

**Challenge:** IE11 doesn't support CSS custom properties
**Mitigation:**

- Use SCSS compilation for IE11 fallbacks
- Implement runtime CSS variable polyfill
- Provide fallback values for all custom properties

### 8. Recommended Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Core Setup

1. Install Lit 3.x with TypeScript
2. Configure build system for modern browsers
3. Set up development environment

#### Phase 2: IE11 Support

1. Add polyfill configuration
2. Implement conditional polyfill loading
3. Test IE11 compatibility

#### Phase 3: Optimization

1. Configure tree shaking
2. Optimize bundle size
3. Implement performance monitoring

### 9. Dependencies and Peer Dependencies

**Required Dependencies:**

```json
{
	"lit": "^3.1.2",
	"@types/node": "^20.x"
}
```

**Development Dependencies:**

```json
{
	"@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs": "^2.8.0",
	"typescript": "^5.x"
}
```

### 10. Migration Path

**From Vanilla Web Components:**

- Minimal changes required
