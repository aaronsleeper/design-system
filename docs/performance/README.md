# Performance Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive performance documentation and testing infrastructure for the design system. The performance benchmarks ensure the system remains performant as it scales and provide clear metrics for optimization efforts.

## Files

- **`benchmarks.md`** - Comprehensive performance benchmarks and targets
- **`README.md`** - This overview file

## Performance Benchmarks

### Bundle Size Targets

All components have defined bundle size targets based on their complexity:

- **Simple components** (input, badge, divider): ≤ 2KB
- **Medium components** (card, grid, alert): ≤ 3KB
- **Complex components** (button, sidebar, modal): ≤ 5KB
- **Core bundles**: ESM ≤ 20KB, UMD ≤ 25KB, CSS ≤ 20KB

### Runtime Performance Targets

- **Component initialization**: ≤ 100ms (complex), ≤ 50ms (simple)
- **Event handling**: ≤ 16ms (clicks), ≤ 8ms (inputs)
- **Memory usage**: ≤ 1KB per component instance
- **Lighting calculations**: ≤ 5ms per calculation, 60fps target

## Testing Infrastructure

### Performance Tests

Run performance tests with:

```bash
npm run test:performance
```

### Bundle Analysis

Generate bundle analysis with:

```bash
npm run analyze
```

This creates a visual bundle analysis at `dist/bundle-analysis.html`.

### Component Benchmarks

Run component benchmarks with:

```bash
npm run benchmark
```

## Current Performance Status

✅ **All performance targets are currently being met:**

- ESM Bundle: 15.1KB / 20KB target
- UMD Bundle: 15.3KB / 25KB target
- CSS Bundle: 16.1KB / 20KB target
- All 24 components under their size targets
- Performance tests passing (24/24)

## Performance Monitoring

### Continuous Monitoring

Performance is monitored through:

1. **Automated tests** - Jest performance tests run on every build
2. **Bundle analysis** - Visual bundle composition analysis
3. **Component benchmarks** - Individual component performance validation
4. **Memory monitoring** - Runtime memory usage tracking

### Performance Budgets

The system enforces performance budgets to prevent regressions:

- **Bundle size budgets** - Hard limits on bundle sizes
- **Runtime budgets** - Maximum acceptable initialization and event times
- **Memory budgets** - Memory usage limits per component
- **Lighting budgets** - Real-time calculation performance targets

## Optimization Strategies

### Bundle Optimization

- Tree-shaking for unused code elimination
- CSS custom properties for style reuse
- Component isolation for independent loading
- Shared utility extraction

### Runtime Optimization

- Event delegation for dynamic content
- Debouncing for input events
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Memory leak prevention

### Lighting System Optimization

- Spatial partitioning with quadtree
- Lazy calculation for visible elements only
- Caching for static elements
- Batch processing for multiple updates

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Optimizations

- [ ] PurgeCSS integration for unused style removal
- [ ] Critical CSS extraction and inlining
- [ ] Advanced tree-shaking improvements
- [ ] Performance regression testing in CI/CD

### Monitoring Improvements

- [ ] Real User Monitoring (RUM) integration
- [ ] Performance alerting system
- [ ] Automated performance regression detection
- [ ] Performance dashboard

## Usage Examples

### Running Performance Tests

```bash
# Run all performance tests
npm run test:performance

# Run performance tests in watch mode
npm run test:performance:watch

# Run component benchmarks
npm run benchmark

# Generate bundle analysis
npm run analyze
```

### Performance Validation

```typescript
import { PerformanceBenchmark } from './src/test/performance/benchmarks';

// Validate a component's performance
const benchmark = await PerformanceBenchmark.runComponentBenchmark(
	'ds-button-primary',
	5 * 1024, // 5KB target
	100, // 100ms init target
	16 // 16ms event target
);

const validation = PerformanceBenchmark.validateBenchmark(benchmark);
console.log('Performance validation:', validation);
```

### Lighting Performance Monitoring

```typescript
import { LightingPerformanceMonitor } from './src/test/performance/benchmarks';

const monitor = new LightingPerformanceMonitor();
monitor.startMonitoring();

// Record shadow calculations
monitor.recordCalculation(3); // 3ms calculation
monitor.recordCalculation(4); // 4ms calculation

const metrics = monitor.getMetrics();
const validation = monitor.validatePerformance();
```

## Conclusion

The performance infrastructure provides comprehensive monitoring and validation of the design system's performance characteristics. All current targets are being met, and the system is well-positioned for future scaling and optimization efforts.

Regular performance testing and monitoring ensure the system maintains its performance characteristics as new features are added and the component library grows.
